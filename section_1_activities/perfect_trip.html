        <div class="small-paragraph"><p>Yucatan, also known as the <strong>hidden gem of Mexico</strong>, has some of the most beautiful scenery the world. It is <strong>green</strong> and <strong>sunny</strong> year-round. It has a rich cultural heritage and is a place that all people interested in ancient history and archeology must visit.</p></div>
<p><span class="tab"></span>Yucatan is one of my favorite places on earth. I have been there on a study abroad and I love the food more than any other place I have been. It is also the homeland of my wife, which makes me love it even more. Yucatan has a lot of Mayan influence and the mayan culture is still very much alive there. It is an amazing place. Everyone must experience the <a href="#scenery">scenery</a>, <span>animals</span>, and <a href="#food">food</a> of the Yucatan Peninsula</p>

<p>You can experience the scenery, animals, and food of the Yucatan Peninsula</p>
